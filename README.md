# silent-missing-encounters
Code to implement the analyses reported in Denham and Hatfield "Silent Missingness in Medicaid TAF Data: Can We Fix What We Canâ€™t See?"
The code to run the simulation will replicate the results in the paper. The TAF application code runs on synthetic data.
We include both the code used to create the real analysis files using TAF data and the code to create the synthetic TAF-like data.
